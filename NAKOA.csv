For the food, I rate 3/5, I don't really like the mentai crab stick rice (if I don't forget the name), because it tastes just like mentai sauce and rice with added crab flavored spices, while the price is quite expensive.  but I really like the matcha latte, chamomile hot tea and the matcha cheese boba.

It turns out this place is very child friendly. Even though there is no baby chair provided, the location is so good for children. Can be indoors or outdoors. They can enjoy the place. The snacks provided are also acceptable for my children aged 1 year and 2.5 years. Even though there are lots of coffee menus, there are also non-coffee menus which are certainly suitable for children. There are also elementary school children who are invited here by their parents.
The service? Very very very good. They understand mothers' predicament, they help them cut the croffles. Asked whether he could carry it himself or needed help.
Those who were initially hesitant to bring children felt comfortable here.
Thank you Nakoa Suhat! U deserve a 7 stars... or ten? ??
